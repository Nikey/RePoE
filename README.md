# RePoE

Repository of Path of Exile resources for tool developers.

Contains data about stats, mods, base items, gems and more. See the `data`
folder for those files and the `docs` folder for their documentation.

For the actual GGPK parsing, [PyPoE](https://github.com/OmegaK2/PyPoE) is used.
The code here just converts PyPoE's Python objects to JSON.

Developed to supply [PoESkillTree](https://github.com/PoESkillTree/PoESkillTree) with the
game data information it requires. If you need other files converted, feel free to
open an Issue or Pull Request for that.

## Files

The [data](data) folder contains the generated data in Json format. Each file has a
formatted and a compact version. The formatted versions complement their descriptions
in the [docs](docs) folder.

Note that the file formats are not final, they may change at any time, e.g. when the format
of files in the GGPK changes. 

The following data is currently available:

- `stat_translations.json`: Maps stat ids together with their values to human-readable
  text. This is the text that appears on items in-game.
- `stats.json`: Describes stat ids. Defines whether they are local and whether they
  are aliased depending on main-hand or off-hand.
- `mods.json`: Describes mod ids. Defines which items they can appear on and what
  stats with what values they have.
- `crafting_bench_options.json`: Describes master craftable mods. Defines which
  masters can craft them at which level on which items.
- `npc_master.json`: Describes the master's signature mods and on which items they
  can appear.
- `gems.json`: Describes skill gems and skill gem effects only provided by mods.
- `gem_tags.json`: Simple object that contains all gem tags with their internal id as
  keys and their translation as value.
- `gem_tooltips.json`: Describes tooltips for skill gems and skill gem effects only
  provided by mods.
- `base_items.json`: Describes base item types. Contains information applicable to
  all item types, e.g. inventory size, item class and tags, as well as attribute
  requirements and properties.
- `tags.json`: Lists all possible item tags. These are the tags used in `base_items.json` and 
  `mods.json`.
- `item_classes.json`: Defines the item class ids and the tags added to items when they are
  Shaper/Elder items.
- `essences.json`: Describes essences. Defines the mods they spawn on items of the different
  item classes and general information like level and tier.
- `default_monster_stats.json`: Describes the stat base values of monsters at specific levels.
- `characters.json`: Describes the stat base values of the different player character classes.
- `fossils.json`: Describes fossils. Defines the mods they spawn, the tags they affect, and 
  auxillary effects of the fossils.
- `mod_types.json`: Describes the types of mods with sell price information and the tags
  relevant for fossil crafting.
